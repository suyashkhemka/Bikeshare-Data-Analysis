# Bikeshare-Data-Analysis
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. 
## Introduction
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

## Posing Questions

Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?

**Question 1**: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.

**Answer**: 1. What is the average amount of time that the people generally use the bikes by different regions. The pricing strategy can be affected by the results. 2. What localities have higher demands than the rest to ensure more efficient rebalancing of the bikes as physical resources.

This block of text is written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is a way to format text using headers, links, italics, and many other options using a plain-text syntax. You will also use Markdown later in the Nanodegree program. Use **Shift** + **Enter** or **Shift** + **Return** to run the cell and show its rendered form.
